Jamify is a music-streaming web application for license-free music, wherein music is organized around "moods" and users can upload their own license-free music to various moods.

The application is built with React.js, Redux-thunk (for asynchronous state management), and axios on the frontend (muzik-front folder), and Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL on the backend (jamify-api folder). It is hosted on heroku, and can be visited here: https://jamify-muzik.herokuapp.com/
